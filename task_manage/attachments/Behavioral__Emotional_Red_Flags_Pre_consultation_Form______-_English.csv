"If English is selected, then these questions should appear",1,Does your child have Frequent Temper Tantrums & show aggression?,Yes,Yes,Frequent Temper Tantrums & Aggression,"Frequent temper tantrums may indicate underlying emotional regulation issues or developmental disorders. Such behavior could be symptomatic of ADHD, autism spectrum disorder, or mood disorders like depression or anxiety. It's essential to assess the context of these tantrums, their frequency, and triggers. A comprehensive evaluation, including a behavioral assessment and possibly psychological testing, should be considered to differentiate between typical developmental stages and more concerning underlying conditions. The next steps may include a referral to a pediatric psychologist or psychiatrist for further evaluation and potentially initiating a behavior management plan.

,2,Does your child feel anxious while facing new experiences impacting daily life ?,Yes,Yes,Anxiety while facing new experiences impacting daily life,"Anxiety when facing new experiences that significantly impacts daily life can indicate an anxiety disorder, such as generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder, or specific phobias. This level of anxiety can interfere with the child's ability to function and engage in age-appropriate activities, affecting their social, academic, and family life. A detailed assessment of the child's anxiety symptoms, including their onset, duration, and specific triggers, is crucial. This should be complemented by a comprehensive clinical interview, observation, and standardized anxiety assessment tools. Depending on the findings, the next steps could involve cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT) aimed at anxiety management, family therapy to address any contributing dynamics, and, if necessary, a psychiatric consultation for consideration of medication.","Article 1 Link ---https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC181152/#:~:text=Social%20Anxiety%20Disorder%3A-,More,-Than%20Just%20a

,3,Is your child easily distracted & find difficulty in concentration?,Yes,Yes, Gets easily distracted & find difficulty in concentration,"Easily getting distracted can be a sign of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), especially if it is consistent across different settings and impacts the child's academic performance or daily activities. It is crucial to differentiate between normal age-appropriate behavior and symptoms that may indicate ADHD or other learning disabilities. A detailed history, including feedback from teachers and caregivers, alongside standardized assessments for ADHD, should be part of the diagnostic process. The next steps might involve neuropsychological testing to rule out other cognitive disorders and discussing potential treatment options such as behavior therapy and/or medication.

,4,Does your child battle over food and is fussy about eating?,Yes,Yes, Battles over food and eating and is fussy about eating,"Battles over food and eating can signify possible feeding disorders, eating disorders like ARFID (Avoidant/Restrictive Food Intake Disorder), or more general anxiety disorders. It is essential to understand the context of these battles, including any specific triggers, the child's growth and development history, and family dynamics around food. A multidisciplinary approach involving a pediatrician, nutritionist, and child psychologist or psychiatrist may be necessary for a comprehensive evaluation. The treatment plan might include nutritional counseling, family therapy, and strategies for managing anxiety or other underlying psychological issues affecting the child's eating behavior.

,5,Does your child show persistant irritability & mood swings ?,Yes,Yes,Persistant irritability & mood swings ,"Persistent irritability and mood swings in children can be indicative of underlying mood disorders, such as depression or bipolar disorder, or can be symptoms of environmental stress, trauma, or other psychological issues. These symptoms can severely affect the child's relationships, school performance, and overall quality of life. A thorough evaluation is necessary to understand the full scope of the child's emotional experiences, behavioral context, and any associated symptoms (e.g., changes in sleep, appetite, or concentration). This evaluation should include interviews with the child and parents, behavioral observations, and possibly psychological testing. The differential diagnosis process might also explore the child's life for stressors or traumas. Treatment plans could include psychotherapy, family therapy, and, in some cases, psychiatric evaluation for medication management.","Article Link https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4470558/#:~:text=Irritability%20in-,children,-and%20adolescents%3A%20past",Y,EmoScreen assesment

It's important to differentiate these disorders from normal developmental phases and to assess for co-occurring conditions such as ADHD, which can complicate compliance. A thorough behavioral assessment, potentially including school observations and psychological testing, is necessary. Management may involve parent management training, psychotherapy, and, if applicable, treatment of any co-existing mental health disorders.

,7,Is your child fidgety & unable to sit still ?,Yes,Yes, Unable to sit still (Fidgety),"A child who is unable to sit still and appears fidgety may be displaying signs of ADHD, particularly the hyperactive-impulsive presentation. This behavior can hinder the child's academic achievement and social interactions. Distinguishing between normal energy levels and those symptomatic of ADHD requires a detailed history of symptoms across different settings, along with input from educators and caregivers. Standardized ADHD rating scales and possibly a neuropsychological evaluation are essential for accurate diagnosis. Treatment strategies may include behavioral interventions, educational accommodations, and possibly medication.

,8,Does your child act younger than children at his or her age?,Yes,Yes,Acts younger than children at his or her age,"Acting significantly younger than their peers can be a red flag for developmental delays or emotional disorders. It might indicate issues with social or emotional development, potentially stemming from autism spectrum disorder, cognitive impairments, or attachment issues. A thorough developmental history, observational assessments, and possibly psychological or educational testing will help clarify the nature of the delays. Intervention plans should be tailored to the child's specific needs, potentially involving speech and language therapy, occupational therapy, or psychotherapeutic interventions to support emotional and social development.

,9,"Does your child use screens excessively and is resistant to be away from it? (Example: Screens refers to Tv, mobile, laptop etc.)",Yes,Yes,"Uses screens (Screens refers to TV, mobile, laptop etc.) excessively and is resistant to be away from it","Excessive screen use and resistance to disengage from screens can indicate underlying behavioral or emotional issues, including screen addiction, poor impulse control, or using screens as a coping mechanism for stress or undiagnosed mental health disorders such as depression or anxiety. This behavior can also impact physical health, sleep patterns, and social skills development. A comprehensive evaluation to explore these potential issues, including the child's overall emotional well-being, family dynamics, and any stressors, is crucial. The assessment should also include a screen time inventory to understand the extent and content of use. Intervention might involve setting structured screen time limits, promoting alternative activities to encourage a balanced lifestyle, and, if necessary, therapy to address underlying emotional or behavioral concerns.

It's essential to conduct a thorough educational and psychological assessment to identify the root cause of the academic decline. This assessment should include a review of the child's academic records, interviews with teachers and parents, and standardized testing to evaluate cognitive abilities, learning styles, and any areas of difficulty. Based on the findings, a tailored intervention plan may be developed, potentially including educational support services, counseling, or treatment for any identified mental health conditions.
